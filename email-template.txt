Hi [First Name],

I have a quick question about [Company Name]'s current approach to finding new buyers.

Are you primarily:
• Relying on referrals and existing relationships?
• Using traditional trade shows and exhibitions?
• Working through distributors and agents?

I ask because arabazaar provides an alternative channel that many GCC suppliers are finding valuable.

What we offer: A marketplace where your products get in front of verified buyers across UAE, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, and Oman - without middlemen or complex processes.

How it's different from other platforms:
• Verification process for both suppliers and buyers
• Direct WhatsApp communication
• Transparent fee structure
• Built specifically for GCC trade dynamics

Particularly relevant if:
• You manufacture or wholesale construction or industrial products (we cater to other industries too!)
• You want more control over buyer relationships
• You prefer direct negotiation to multi-tier distribution

Registration is simple and doesn't require upfront payment. We verify businesses to maintain quality, which typically takes 24-48 hours.

Would it make sense to explore whether this could complement [Company Name]'s existing sales channels?

Best regards,
Fatima
